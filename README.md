# Fairly
Example Components that I created while working with Fairly.

Each Folder Contains a Screen shot of the Components UI in the React Folder as well as the Code files it is comprised of.

The .Net Folder for each component contains the Code I wrote for the API Controllers, Service Files, Interfaces and Models.
