# Fairly
Example Components that I created while working with Fairly.

Fairly is a SaaS platform that enambles talent acquisition teams to quickly find and hire high quaility, diverse talent. 

I worked on creating the MVP, and due to the proprietary nature, I can only provide code snippets of portions that I worked on.
This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Users Registartion and Login, Paypal donations page, and the view for admin to create new charitable funds.
